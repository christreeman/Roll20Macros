&{template:desc} {{desc= **Vision and Light**

The most fundamental tasks of adventuring–noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few–rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. 

In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures ***have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight***. 

A **heavily obscured** area–such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage–blocks vision entirely. ***A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix PH-A) when trying to see something in that area.***}}

&{template:desc} {{desc= **Light Levels** 

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a **lightly obscured** area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

**Darkness** creates a **heavily obscured** area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.}}
