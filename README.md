# Roll20Macros
Repo full of macros and api tools for running my campaigns

Many of the tables were picked up from the public google drive sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y5fMpkcm615KH_9ih-HCagswAdgS1CkBiktKeJABiBY/edit#)

# Roll20 API tools I use
| API Script | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| **GroupCheck** | This tool is great for running any type of 5e check for multiple tokens at once |
| **TokenMod** | Necessary tool for modifying token properties i.e. Vision and Bar settings |
| **TableExport** | Needed for importing/exporting the table recipes in ```/Tables``` |
| **GroupInitiative** | Good for rolling initiative for every token at once. You can also roll for players, but they hate you when you do. |
| **RecursiveTable** | Needed to roll the inline rolls embedded within tables |
| **PublicSheet** | This one runs like shit. You can use it to make uneditable sheets so players can see their friends character sheets. |

For PublicSheet, you can achieve a good holdover but just duplicating the character token, and giving everyone access. If you don't play with assholes, it works fine.
